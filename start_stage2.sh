#
# Start Stage 2 import script with process group management
#
# This script starts the import_papers_stage2_conferences.py script in the background
# and manages it as a process group, making it easy to stop all processes with one command.
#
# Usage:
#   ./start_stage2.sh [OPTIONS]
#
# Options are passed directly to the Python script:
#   --batch-size N      Batch size for processing (default: 10000)
#   --skip-rebuild      Skip index rebuild after insert
#   --keep-indexes      Keep indexes during insert (slower)
#
# Examples:
#   ./start_stage2.sh
#   ./start_stage2.sh --batch-size 20000
#   ./start_stage2.sh --skip-rebuild
#
# To stop the script:
#   ./stop_stage2.sh
#
